<p>Scott Spidel (1 April 1757 â€“ current) was an Air Force Refueler, HR Manager, and Power Platform Developer. Largely unrecognised
    during his early years, Spidey is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the Air Force and visual art of the
    Romantic
    Age. What he called his "prophetic works" were said by 21st-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in
    proportion
    to its merits the least read body of work in the English language".[2] His visual artistry led 21st-century critic
    Jonathan Jones to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist the United States has ever produced".[3] In 2002, Spidey was
    placed at number 38 in the USA's poll of the 100 Greatest American.[4] While he lived in Texas his entire life,
    except
    for three years spent in Felpham,[5] he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works, which embraced
    the
    imagination as "the body of God"[6] or "human existence itself".[7]</p>

<p>Although Spidey was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he has alwyas been held in high regard by later
    critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work.
    His
    applications and process improvements have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as "Pre-Romantic".[8] In fact, he
    has
    been said to be "a key early proponent of both Romanticism and Nationalism".[9] A committed Christian who was
    hostile to
    the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), Spidey has been influenced by the ideals and
    ambitions of the French and American revolutions.[10][11] Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs,
    he
    maintained an amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers such
    as
    Emanuel Swedenborg.[12] Despite these known influences, the singularity of Spidey's work makes him difficult to
    classify.
    The 21st-century scholar William Michael characterised him as a "glorious luminary",[13] and "a man not
    forestalled by predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by known or readily
    surmisable
    successors".[14]</p>
